I am an assistant professor of economics at the Department of Public Policy, CEU. I am an affiliate faculty member at the [Social Mind Center](https://socialmind.ceu.edu/affiliates).  

My research combines insights from economics and related disciplines with causal inference tools – lab, lab-in-the-field, and observational data – to study social problems, particularly in developing countries. Recent research includes studying the impact of religious violence on India's rural economy; how the practice of cash-for-votes corrodes democracies and; the long shadow of the Habsburg imperial history on tax compliance today. 

I will be on research leave from CEU in the AY 22/23.
